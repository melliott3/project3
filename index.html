        <h3>Scene 1 Description Below:</h3>
          <p>(The story is set in a mall. It is 9:00 am on a Saturday. Jane and Mary are at the mall. Mary is 18 and is best friends with Jane. Jane is 19 and is best friends with Mary, Jane's father is a decorated police lieutenant with 25 years of experience in the police force. Mary and Jane are standing side by side and are hiding in one of the unpopular stores in the mall so they won't be seen by the police.)</p>
          <h4>Scene 1</h4>
          <p>JANE: We are in big trouble.</p>
          <p>MARY: I  told you that we shouldn't even be here. We could've been binge watching something on Hulu or watching movies on Netflix or-</p>
          <p>JANE: Can you just shut up and stop nagging me? I already apologized-</p>
          <p>MARY: Let me remind you that you were the one who suggested that we use your dad's car to go to the mall, and that we take his credit card so that we could have a shopping spree?</p>
          <p>JANE: Ok, ok, I get it! It's my bad alright?</p>
          <p>MARY: No it's not alright, we might go to jail for using it! What if your dad sees the transactions and thinks someone else stole it and gets the police involved or-</p>
          <p>JANE: Did you forget that my dad's a police lieutenant?</p>
          <p>MARY: That only helps to better rationalize my case! Are you even trying to win this argument?</p>
          <p>JANE: No, I'm more worried about my dad and his cop buddies that are trying to trace where his card was last used. So I'm sorry if winning a petty argument isn't the most important thing on my mind right now!</p>
          <p>MARY: Well, even though you're my bff, I still blame you for this! Ugh, I guess we'll have to try and sneak out of the mall without being seen. It's not like it's our first time doing something stupid like this. If only we stayed at your house like we planned...</p>
          <p>JANE: If only…</p>

        <h3>Scene 3 Description Below:</h3>
          <p>(Time skip to the summer. Mary and Jane are staying in a lake house owned by Mary’s dad, who is a wealthy businessman. It is mid-July and they are in Mary’s room in the mansion. They are trying to figure out how to replace or repair something that they have broken in the lake house. Mary’s dad is not home yet, but he has informed Mary that he will be arriving soon. But they don’t know that what they have broken is irreplaceable.)</p>
          <h4>Scene 3</h4>
          <p>MARY:  Ok, so we could have been chilling by the pool or swimming in the pool, relaxing and having a good time but “no” you just couldn’t try to be more careful about your surroundings!</p>
          <p>JANE: I’ve told you that I was deeply sorry about it and that I would try to repair the painting or replace it somehow-</p>
          <p>MARY: How would you do that…?</p>
          <p>JANE: Wait, what are you talking about? I would try to ask my dad for the money, but I don’t know how much I need, since I don’t know how much it costs.</p>
          <p>MARY: Even if you did know how much it costs, how would you be able to convince your dad to pay you enough to get it fixed or replaced?</p>
          <p>JANE: I would just tell him it’s for school or something. Why does this matter? I-</p>
          <p>MARY: Well, it matters because I just looked up the painting online, and it’s priceless!</p>
          <p>JANE: Wow… I’m so sorry, I’ll tell your dad about it and hopefully he won’t punish you...</p>
          <p>MARY: Well maybe if you weren’t so clumsy and would try to look where you are going, then we wouldn't even be in this mess to be with!! This is all -</p>
          <p>JANE: My fault… I know, ok? You’re right, maybe I should’ve been more careful as to not run around in your lake house, I’ll just see myself out, and just tell your dad it was me and that I’ll never be here again, ok? I’m so sorry… (Jane exits)</p>
          <p>MARY: This is all my fault… I should not have said that…</p>
